What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
ans-.git directory is created containing meta data of repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
ans-staging area acts like intermidiate between working directory and respo.The working directory is converted into git respo but git provide more control to how we add commit.So instead of adding changes directly to respo git let up first add to staging area and if we are sure then from stagging area we can add it to the respo. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
ans-use git diff to see the changes made in working directory and stagging area and we can see the file is modified or not in working directory using "git stauts"

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
ans-branches is very powerful tool, helps to experiment the code we have,like the asteroid game we are working on,since the asteroid game was hard to play to we try to make the another version of game (easy-mode) still we can access the difficult version of game too which was stored at master branch
