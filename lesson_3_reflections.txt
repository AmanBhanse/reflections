1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
ans-We use the remote respository to collaborate with different contributers around the world
    and to make our project public and allow others to contribute it.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
ans-becoz the local respository and remote needs manual syncing.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
ans-clone-> are used when u want copy of repo from githubserver or to another location on ur computer.
----
branch-> are use in repo only to work parallelly on different features of project or experimental features then we can merge them too.
---
forks->They are used to make the copy of someone other's remote to our github remote at githubservers
