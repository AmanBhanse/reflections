1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
ans-We use the remote respository to collaborate with different contributers around the world
    and to make our project public and allow others to contribute it.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
ans-becoz the local respository and remote needs manual syncing.
